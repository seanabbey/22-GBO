        <h2>The Barrier Reef Orchestra</h2>
        <h3>A North Queensland Icon</h3>
        <p><br/>Fast becoming one of North Queensland's cultural jewels the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches
            its
            15th year
            of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting of the finest
            musicians
            drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions.
            <br/><br/>An outstanding performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was
            recently
            followed
            by Peter Sculthorpe's Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios.
            The
            programs
            are testament to the orchestra's willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as
            opportunities
            for
            collaboration.
            <br/><br/>In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the
            Townsville
            Civic
            Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting
            its
            continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland.</p>

        <h3>
            PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE — Andrew Ryder
        </h3>

        <br>

        <p>
            Welcome to 2016 which is going to be a stellar year for your Orchestra. Already we have our three major
            concerts which will include opera, featuring Paul Tabone born in Ingham, but now working the international
            stage as a tenor based in Italy. Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.2 featuring last year’s winner of the instrumental
            section of the ACVC, Arthur Athan. Our opening performance titled Dreams and Dances is sure to have some favourites
            such as Afternoon of a Fawn by Debussy. We are also pleased to be part of the Townsville 150 Concert where we will
            share the stage with the likes of David Campbell, Luke Kennedy, Bronwyn Douglas and the 1 RAR Band just to
            name a few of the guests. We will be back to Queens Gardens for a repeat performance as part of AFCM due to
            the huge popularity of last year’s concert. All of these performances are ably managed by our Orchestra Manager,
            Sally Frewen-Lord and the wonderful team that is your committee.
            <br>
            <br>
            As we look forward to the next milestone for the Orchestra in 2020 it is worthwhile to reflect on the
            development and struggles the BRO has endured. It is through the Townsville Council’s financial support that
            started the ball rolling and assisted with seed funding that has allowed BRO to develop to where it is today.
            Initially, this funding represented the majority of the turnover for BRO. Through the hard work of the committee
            and the musicians the Council funding is now around 20% of the turnover. In my opinion this is a substantial
            move forward and shows the Council’s support is well founded and supported by the public attendance at our
            concerts. It is crucial that the support from the Council be maintained into the future to assist BRO to grow.
            The funding is not taken as a given and we must all do our bit to let the Council know how important it is to
            continue the development of BRO for Townsville audiences and local musicians. I urge all members to make this
            point as often and as loudly as you can to ensure the Council knows it is getting value for money and meeting
            the needs of the community.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, the AGM is soon to be upon us and there will be some vacancies on the committee. My reign of terror
            will be coming to an end as I will be stepping down, so we will be looking for a new President. I am flagging
            this now to allow the search to begin for the next President. I can assure any prospective nominees that they
            will find a willing and dynamic committee at their disposal and a myriad of challenges just waiting to be resolved.
            I can highly commend this position and would be pleased to speak to anyone considering the position.
            See you all at the launch.
