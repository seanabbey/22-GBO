<h2>The Barrier Reef Orchestra - A North Queensland Icon</h2>
<p><br/>Fast becoming one of North Queensland's cultural jewels the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches its 15th year
    of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting of the finest musicians
    drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions.
    <br/><br/>An outstanding performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed
    by Peter Sculthorpe's Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs
    are testament to the orchestra's willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for
    collaboration.
    <br/><br/>In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic
    Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its
    continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland.
