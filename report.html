<h2>PMI</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Everyone in the group helped eachother and contributed to the overall assignment. All members have enjoyed the process and working together to complete the final product.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Some of the pages weren't completed till quite close to the due date which added stress and shows that an earlier start in the project may have been required. There were some disagreements although not many and were resolved quickly. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting:  </strong>It was interesting to work in a group with each member having different ways to contribute (e.g. Someone good with design and someone good with CSS). This meant everyone in the group had something to contribute as well as learn from the other members. The lesson of better time-management was learnt as well as new ways to manipulate CSS and HTML.</p>
