<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 22</h2>
<p><strong>Members: </strong>Matthew Chilcott, Nando Retallick-Boundey, Sean Abbey, Bonnie Thompson</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The GBO aims to attract more members, sponsors and donors. They also want to increase  their target audeince range to one similar to that of members in their Orchestra meaning ages roughly 13-73 years old.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to evaluate their success they can monitor the ticket sales prior to the websites launch, and ticket sales after. Alongside this they could possibly ask the ticket sales venues to record the age of people making purchases so that they could then compare this data to their ideal audience ages.<br>
  They can also keep track of the rate of how many people were signing up (say monthly) to be donors, sponsors and members prior to the websites launch and compare that to the figures after the websites launch.. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>They wish to appeal to an audience similar to that of the members in their Orchestra, so the target audience would range from 14 to 73 years old.</p>
